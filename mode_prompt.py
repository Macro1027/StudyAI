Example answers: Answer A
Hyper-inflation cametoGerman yafter the French occupied the Ruhr because the Germans
had not been keeping up with their reparations payments.The German government decided
that the way to make these payments was to print more money. By 1923 they had a lot of
paper mills who were doing nothing else except print money. This led to a fall in the value of
the markand hyperinflation in Germany. Hyperinflation led to manyGermans beingforced
into poverty.
Examiner Comment
The answer shows a misunderstanding of the demands of the question. What is
required is an explanation of the effects of hyperinflation, whereas this answer is
almost totally concerned with the causes.The only consideration of consequence is in
the last line.
The answer would be marked at Level 1 for generalised information about the topic,
with a simple comment about consequence.
Answer B
Oneoftheeffects of hyperinflation was that manypeople losttheir savings.If you hadbeen
saving for many years and had managedto havea good sum of money, now you foundthat
you didn’t really! In January 1923 it cost 250 marks to buy a loaf. In November 1923 it cost
over 200 billion marks. Prices had risen very steeply.
Examiner Comment
The answer explains a consequence of hyperinflation and provides some specific
information to support the explanation. There is no explanation of the consequences of
the steep rise in prices (ie the outcome of this feature of the period). Both of these
elements of the answer, therefore are in Level 2.
The answer would be marked at Level 2 and could not score more than 4 marks,
because only one consequence has been addressed.
Answer C
Hyper inflation in Germany was one of the reasons why the Weimar Republic was eventually
overthrown. People blamed the government for signing Versailles and accepting the
reparations terms.So, whenGermany failed to keep upthose payments and had to print
money to make any payments, the resulting hyperinflation was blamed on the Weimar
government. It wasn’t overthrown immediately (though Hitler did try) because Stresemann
was able to introduce measures which ended hyperinflation and restored stability. But when
the Wall St. Crash came in 1929 and the economy collapsed again, many people
remembered the economic chaos in the hyperinflation years and turned to more extreme
parties, thus causing the Weimar Republic to fall.
PearsonEdexcel International GCSE History Paper 1 Depth example answers 5
Another consequence of hyperinflation was that prices rose very steeply in Germany. Money
became so worthless that there were stories of people stealing handbags ,keeping the bag
and throwing the money away. It was even said that if you went for a meal in a restaurant,
you should pay forthe meal before you had eatenit, because prices would have gone up
before you finished. Life must have been very difficult.
Examiner Comment
There are two separate consequence addressed in this answer.The first paragraph is a
very well -constructed analysis of the consequences of hyperinflation in the longerterm
and how it led to the stated outcome (the fall of the Weimar Republic). It is also
supported with accurate and relevant information, showing a good knowledge and
understanding of the characteristics of Nazi Germany. Both elements of the mark
scheme in Level3 can be seen clearly in the answer. However, the second paragraph
provides much less accurate and relevant information and does not link this
information to a stated outcome. This part of the answer is only Level 2.
The answerwould be marked at lowLevel3, as it has one paragraph operating at Level
3 and one at Level 2.''',
